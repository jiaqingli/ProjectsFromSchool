# ProjectsFromSchool
Here are some projects I did during my undergrad and grad school related to robotics and control.

Hw12_lab and Hw13_lab are from a undergrad course. Forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and path planning are involved. There are captures of simulation results. There are L5 and L6 robot arms for testing in the lab as well. 

Project is from a grad-level network control course. Network control and formation control are used.

Hackathing is a competition project. There are multiple stepper motors involved. ANd an arduino is used to control the timing of the stepper motors.
